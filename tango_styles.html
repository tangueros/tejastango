<p>In Buenos Aires and other parts of Argentina, tango is danced in a spectrum
of individualistic or personal styles, and many tango dancers who are Argentine
do not accept a categorization of their own dancing by any broad stylistic
name.&nbsp; They simply say they are dancing tango, their own style, or
the style of their neighborhood or city.&nbsp; A few confuse the issue
further by identifying their own style by a name that other dancers associate
with a different style.&nbsp; Consequently, parsing the commonalities and
differences that can be found across the continuum of individual styles
to clearly describe the characteristics of various styles is challenging,
potentially controversial, and possibly misleading.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
if we regard style to mean an approach to dancing that creates incompatibilities
with other approaches and has a sufficient number of adherents who stick
firmly to the listed elements, I think it is possible to create rough definitions
for a number of distinguishable styles of Argentine tango: tango de salon,
Villa Urquiza, milonguero, club, orillero, canyengue, nuevo, fantasia and tango
escenario.

<h3><a NAME="salon"></a>Tango de Salon</h3>
The term "tango de salon" refers to a variety of social dance styles, including
<a href="#urquiza">Villa Urquiza</a>, <a href="#milonguero">milonguero</a> and 
<a href="#club">club-style</a> tangos that are danced socially in salons rather
than for exhibition (like <a href="#fantasia">fantasia</a> or
<a href="#escenario">tango escenario</a>) or in improper venues (like
<a href="#orillero">orillero</a>).&nbsp; 

<p>Traditional tango de salon requires
that dancers exercise respect for the line of dance, but the embraces and
characteristic movements can vary considerably across individual styles.
<p>Outside Argentina, what is sometimes called "salon-style" tango may refer to
the <a href="#urquiza">Villa Urquiza</a>, <a href="#fantasia">tango fantasia</a>,
<a href="#escenario">tango escenario</a> or a blend of these styles.&nbsp; The
blended style can have a looser embrace with a more pronounced V than the Villa
Urquiza style.&nbsp; The greater distance between the partners allows the woman
to execute her turns more freely and pivot without requiring much independent
movement between her hips and torso.&nbsp; The looser embrace accommodates
showy movements and may lead to a blending of styles that many observers
would consider only suitable for exhibitions.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3><a NAME="urquiza"></a>Villa Urquiza</h3>
Named for one of the neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, the Villa Urquiza style of tango
is typically danced with an upright body posture with the two dancers maintaining
separate axes and looking toward the clasped hands of the embrace.&nbsp; The embrace
is typically closed, but the couple loosens the embrace slightly to accomodate the
turns and allow the woman to rotate more freely.&nbsp; The more the woman rotates her
hips through the turns independently of her upper torso, the less the embrace needs to
be loosened.&nbsp; Because both dancers look toward the clasped hands, the embrace may
create an impression of a slight V, in which the woman's left shoulder is closer to the
man's right shoulder than her left shoulder is to to his right.&nbsp; Despite the name,
the style is danced throughout many of the neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, and is
sometimes called "Tango Estilo del Barrio."&nbsp; Outside Argentina, the style is widely
known as "salon-style tango."
<br>&nbsp;

<h3>
<a NAME="milonguero"></a>Milonguero-Style Tango</h3>
Milonguero-style tango is typically danced with a slightly leaning posture
that typically joins the torsos of the two dancers from the tummy through
the solar plexus (in an embrace that some Argentines call apilado) to create
a merged axis while allowing a little bit of distance between the couple's
feet.&nbsp; The embrace is also typically closed with the woman’s right
shoulder as close to her partner's left shoulder as her left shoulder is to
his right, and the woman's left arm is often draped behind the man's
neck.&nbsp; Some practitioners of this style suggest that each dancer lean
against their partner.&nbsp; Others say that the lean is more of an illusion
in which each partner maintains their own balance, but leans forward just
enough to complete the embrace.&nbsp; The couple maintains a constant upper
body contact and does not loosen their embrace to accommodate turns or ochos,
which can limit the couple to walking steps and simple ochos until both
partners develop the skills for the woman to execute her turns by stepping
at an angle rather than pivoting.&nbsp; Milonguero-style dancers typically
respond to the <a href="#ric-tic-tic">ric-tic-tic rhythm</a> that is prominent
in the music of Juan D'Arienzo and Rodolfo Biagi and also found in the
playing of many other tango orchestras.&nbsp; The milonguero style allows
for a more elastic approach to the rhythm when dancing to music that has
a less insistent <a href="#ric-tic-tic">ric-tic-tic rhythm</a>, such as
that recorded by Di Sarli or Pugliese.&nbsp; The ocho cortado is one the
characteristic figures of milonguero-style tango because it integrates
the embrace with rhythmic sensibilities of the style.
<p>Milonguero-style tango can also be identified as apilado-, cafe-, and
confiteria-style tango.&nbsp; One of the better-known dancers of the style,
Tete, referred to his own style as "tango de salon."
<br>&nbsp;

<h3>
<a NAME="club"></a>Club-Style Tango</h3>
Club-style tango has the rhythmic sensibilities of 
<a href="#milonguero">milonguero-style tango</a>,
but it uses a more upright posture, separate axes and close embrace of 
the <a href="#urquiza">Villa Urquiza</a> style of tango.&nbsp; The couple
may loosen their embrace slightly on their turns to allow the woman to
rotate more freely and pivot without requiring much independent movement
between her hips and torso.&nbsp; If the woman rotates her hips through
the turns independently of her upper torso or steps back at an angle, the
embrace need not be loosened as much.&nbsp; Club-style tango is typically
danced to the <a href="#ric-tic-tic">ric-tic-tic rhythm</a> that is prominent
in the music of Juan D'Arienzo and Rodolfo Biagi and also is found in the
playing of many other tango orchestras.&nbsp; Club-style tango uses the ocho
cortado and other rhythmic figures that are found in milonguero-style
tango.&nbsp; Possibly a rhythmic variation of the Villa Urquiza style of tango,
some people regard club-style tango as a mish mash of styles rather than a
separate style.&nbsp; Club style tango is sometimes identified as Tango Estilo
del Centro, referring to its <i>current use</i> in the central area of Buenos
Aires. 
<br>&nbsp;

<h3>
<a NAME="orillero"></a>Orillero-Style Tango</h3>
Orillero-style tango is an older style of tango whose name suggests that
it may have had its origins in the streets of poor outlying tenements in
Buenos Aires.&nbsp; Later it came to refer to the man dancing around the
edge of the woman.&nbsp; In either case, orillero-style tango was not considered
acceptable in the refined salons of central Buenos Aires during the golden
age of tango.&nbsp; To the extent that orillero-style tango is still danced
it has become more like the Villa Urquiza style of tango.&nbsp; It is danced
with upright body posture with the dancers maintaining separate axes, and the
embrace is typically offset in a V and can be either close or open.&nbsp; In the
turns, the woman is allowed to move freely and pivot without requiring much
independent movement between her hips and torso.&nbsp; When orillero-style
tango is danced in a close embrace, the couple loosens the embrace slightly
to accommodate the turns.&nbsp; If the woman rotates her hips through the
turns independently of her upper torso, the embrace need not be loosened
as much.&nbsp; Orillero-style tango differs from salon-style tango because
it adds playful, space-consuming embellishments and figures that do not
always respect the line of dance.&nbsp; Many of the playful elements are
executed to the <a href="#ric-tic-tic">ric-tic-tic rhythm</a> that characterizes
the music of Juan D'Arienzo and Rodolfo Biagi.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3>
<a NAME="canyengue"></a>Canyengue</h3>
Canyengue is a historical form of tango that was danced in the 1920s and
early 30s that may or may not be accurately captured by its current
practitioners.&nbsp; The embrace is close and in an offset V, the dancers
typically have bent knees as they move, and the woman does not execute a
cross.&nbsp; At the time canyengue was popular, dresses were long and tight.&nbsp;
Consequently, the steps were short and frequently executed in the
<a href="#ric-tic-tic">ric-tic-tic rhythm</a> that is characteristic of the tango
music played by the old guard which included Francisco Lomuto, Francisco Canaro
(early in his career), Roberto Firpo, and Juan de Dios Filiberto.&nbsp; (The
modern-era orchestra Los Tubatango played in the same style.)&nbsp; Some dancers
of canyengue use exaggerated body movements to accent their steps.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3>
<a NAME="nuevo"></a>Nuevo Tango</h3>
As it was originally conceived, nuevo tango was largely a pedagogic approach
to tango that emphasized a structural analysis of the dance through which
the connections between tango's elements could be explored and new combinations
and step patterns could be found.&nbsp; Some of the dancers exploring those
possibilities gradually developed nuevo tango into a style that is danced in
an open, loose or elastic embrace with a very upright posture and a great
emphasis on the dancers maintaining their own axes.&nbsp; Although some
advocates of tango nuevo emphasize its structural analysis over specific
figures, some of the most identifiable figures of the style are overturn ochos,
cadenas, linear boleos, volcadas and single axis spins—most of which are best
accomplished in a loose or elastic embrace.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3>
<a NAME="fantasia"></a>Fantasia (Show Tango)</h3>
The term "tango fantasia" refers to an exhibition style of dancing that draws
principally on the Villa Urquiza style of tango but uses embellishments more
extensively and adds dramatic poses, ganchos and high boleos, all of which
have their roots in some part of tango's history.&nbsp; This style developed for
use in exhibitions during breaks in social dancing at milongas, but was carried
to the stage.&nbsp; As the stage style evolved through the addition of elements
outside the tango vocabulary, some people distinguished the result as 
<a href="#escenario">tango escenario</a>.&nbsp; Many people refer to all forms
of exhibition tango as fantasia.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3>
<a NAME="escenario"></a>Tango Escenario (Stage Tango)</h3>
The term "tango escenario" means tango danced in stage shows.&nbsp; This style
originally drew from the idioms of the Villa Urquiza and orillero styles of tango
but today also includes elements of nuevo-tango.&nbsp; Tango escenario is danced
in an open embrace with exaggerated movements and additional elements (often taken
from ballet) that are not part of the social tango vocabulary.&nbsp; The balletic
elements integrate well with the Villa Urquiza style of tango because the way
a couple relates to each other's space in the Villa Urquiza style is very balletic
in nature, even though tango movements are typically more grounded like modern
dance.&nbsp; Many people refer to all forms of exhibition tango as 
<a href="#fantasia">fantasia</a>.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3>
<a NAME="nuevo_milonguero"></a>Nuevo Milonguero</h3>
Nuevo milonguero is a relatively new approach to Argentine tango that adds
some nuevo movements such as cadenas, volcadas and single-axis spins to
milonguero-style tango.&nbsp; It would probably be a stretch to regard nuevo
milonguero as a separate style of tango because the approach is fully compatible
with the movements in milonguero-style tango (if not the sensibilities), and nuevo 
milonguero doesn't have an identifiably separate group of adherents.&nbsp;
Truthfully, nuevo milonguero might be considered the show version of 
milonguero-style tango because the added elements are showy but can be
inappropriate for dancing in crowded venues.
<br>&nbsp;

<h3>
<a NAME="liquid"></a>Liquid Tango</h3>
Liquid tango is approach to dancing Argentine tango in which the embrace shifts
between close and open to allow the integration of various styles of tango, particularly
the nuevo and club styles.&nbsp; It is probably premature to consider this a separate
style of dancing because the approach is largely compatible with nuevo and doesn't
have an identifiably separate group of adherents.

<h3>
<a NAME="additional"></a>Some Additional Comments about Style</h3>

<b>Which Style is Authentic?</b>
<p>All of these styles have some degree of authenticity because they draw
from the practices, idioms, and historical precedents of Argentine tango
as it is and was danced in Buenos Aires, Montevideo, and other cities in
Argentina and Uruguay.&nbsp; Some styles are more popular in a particular
city or in venues within a city, but popularity should not be confused
with authenticity.&nbsp; Fantasia and tango escenario are authentic for
exhibition dancing but not for social dancing.
<p>Some of the confusion about authenticity may be the result of different
styles serving different social purposes during the golden age of tango.&nbsp;
The Villa Urquiza style of tango was danced in very nice clubs, where one was
expected to get dressed up and dance very slowly.&nbsp; The milonguero and club
styles were danced in more crowded venues, some of dubious reputation.&nbsp;
Orillero was considered a lower class or street style of tango.&nbsp; In many
cases, the same individual would dance somewhat different styles in different
venues or to different music.

<p><b>Which Styles Have an Open Embrace and Which Have a Close Embrace?</b>
<p>All of the styles except tango escenario can be danced in a close embrace.&nbsp;
Although Villa Urquiza and orillero-style tango can be danced in a open embrace,
they are more typically danced in a close embrace in Buenos Aires and other
parts of Argentina.&nbsp; Milonguero- and club-style tango are only danced
in a close embrace.&nbsp; The milonguero-style embrace is also typically
closed with the woman's right shoulder as close to her partner's left shoulder
as her left shoulder is to his right.&nbsp; The nuevo embrace is loose
and elastic, but many of the movements that are emphasized in tango nuevo
can be danced in either the apilado or the close offset V embraces.

<p><b>Embrace and Frame</b>
<p>Some people distinguish between milonguero and other styles of tango
by claiming that the frame in milonguero-style tango is in the woman, and
in other styles the frame is created in the arms of the embrace.&nbsp;
Whether the frame is inside the woman or in the arms of the embrace depends
largely upon the closeness and softness of the embrace.&nbsp; A firm, distant
embrace places the frame in the arms of the embrace.&nbsp; As the embrace
becomes closer and softer, the frame is moved into the woman's body in
all styles.

<p><b>What Is Salon-Style Tango?</b>
<p>The term "salon-style" has been applied to a range of styles from Villa Urquiza
to fantasia.&nbsp; Sometimes tango escenario is taught as salon-style tango.&nbsp;
Because the Villa Urquiza style serves as the base for the exhibition styles of tango,
it is relatively easy to add exhibition elements to Villa Urquiza that are inappropriate
for social dancing.&nbsp; Adding these elements belies the name salon-style because the
resulting style is unsuitable for dancing in crowded milongas.

<p><b>Isn't Salon-Style Tango an Exhibition Style of Tango?</b>
<p>What is taught as "salon-style tango" can range from Villa Urquiza to fantasia or
tango escenario.&nbsp; The two exhibition styles can be thought of as an extension
of Villa Urquiza because they rely heavily upon Villa Urquiza tango for a basic set
of movements.&nbsp; Exhibition tango adds showy figures and embellishments (and sometimes
ballet or other theatrical movements) that are inappropriate for social dancing.&nbsp;
Many tango instructors confuse their students by teaching an indistinguishable blend
of social and exhibition figures and calling it salon tango.&nbsp; This hybrid style is
characterized by an open embrace, large steps, dramatic pauses, conspicuous ornamentation,
and sometimes a disregard for the line of dance.&nbsp; The hybrid style is danced socially
by many thousands of dancers outside of Argentina and Uruguay, who are mostly unaware that
their style of dancing of unsuitable for dancing in crowded milongas in Buenos Aires or
elsewhere.

<p><b>Which Styles Are Improvisational and Which Are Choreographed?</b>
<p>All of the styles are potentially improvisational including fantasia and tango
escenario.&nbsp; Stage tango is often choreographed.&nbsp; Exhibitions at milongas can be
improvised or choreographed.&nbsp; Many instructors who describe the style they teach as
salon tango emphasize memorized figures in their teaching.&nbsp; Such teachers may still
intend that their students understand that tango is an improvisational dance that follows
a strict line of movement around the dance floor.

<p><b>Which Styles Are Feeling and Which Are Analytical?</b>
<p>Some people look upon improvisation in Villa Urquiza, orillero, fantasia, and
nuevo tango as puzzle pieces that are assembled as you dance, and those
who teach the structure of tango within these styles can emphasize the
analytical nature of the dance.&nbsp; If these styles are held in the intellectual
domain and not moved into the intuitive and emotional domains, they can
remain a dry, analytical puzzle.&nbsp; Dancers and instructors of milonguero-style
tango often emphasize the intuitive and feeling aspects of the style, but
it can be approached in an equally analytical manner to the other styles.

<p><b>How Are the Milonguero and Club Styles Related?</b>
<p>As described above, the styles are very similar and may be or have become
variations within a single style.&nbsp; According to Edaurdo Arquimbau, a
leading dancer of the style, club-style tango was danced in some of the clubs
de barrios during the 1950s, while milongueros were dancing somewhat different
styles in central Buenos Aires (which Arquimbau seemed to imply was much like
what is now known as Villa Urquiza).&nbsp; Arquimbau also maintains that several
of the better-known milonguero-style dancers took lessons in club-style tango
from him during the 1950s.&nbsp; His claim has led some to raise the possibility
that club-style tango may have played an important role in the development of
milonguero-style tango and that the two styles are essentially the same.&nbsp; 
<p>Other facts point to the possibility of evolutionary convergence.&nbsp;
Club-style tango may have developed as orillero-style dancers moved indoors and
adapted their rhythmic dance to smaller spaces.&nbsp; Milonguero-style tango
may have developed after the tango salons closed, and some dancers modified
their smoother style by adding highly rhythmic elements to create interesting
movement in smaller spaces in which they now had to dance.

<p><a NAME="ric-tic-tic"></a><b>Ric-Tic-Tic Rhythm</b>
<p>Ric-tic-tic is onomatopoeia for the staccato rhythms that are prominent
in the music of Juan D'Arienzo, Rodolfo Biagi, and some other golden-era
orchestras.&nbsp; With Biagi on the piano, D'Arienzo's orchestra debuted
in the 1930s with the ric-tic-tic rhythm.&nbsp; Although some describe
music with the ric-tic-tic rhythm as 2x4, the characteristic rhythm of
this music is actually created through a variation in accented beats that
yields an alternation of single-time and double-time rhythms.&nbsp; For
example, the music might be played <i><b>one</b> and <b>two</b> and, <b>one
and two</b> and,</i> <i><b>one</b> and <b>two</b> and, <b>one and two</b>
and</i> (where boldface represents the accented beats), and the dancers
might respond
<i>slow, slow; quick, quick, slow; slow, slow; quick, quick,
slow</i>.&nbsp; One might express the chararacteristic stacatto rhythm
of this music as <i>one, two; ric, tic, tic; one, two; ric, tic, tic</i>.
<p>Some tangos contain more complex rhythms and longer phrases of double-time
staccato accents.&nbsp; Juan D'Arienzo's "El Flete" contains a rhythmic
figure of <i><b>one</b> and two and <b>one</b> and two and,
<b>one and
two and one</b> and two and, <b>one</b> and <b>two</b> and <b>one</b> and
<b>two</b>
and, <b>one and two and one</b> and two and</i>.&nbsp; For the dancer adhering
strictly to the accents, that rhythmic figure becomes the demanding and
rapid fire <i>slow, pause, slow, pause; quick, quick, quick, quick, slow,
pause; slow, slow, slow, slow; quick, quick, quick, quick, slow, pause</i>.&nbsp;
For a dancer taking the music at half speed, the rhythmic figure becomes
the familiar <i><b>slow</b>, pause, <b>slow</b>, pause; <b>quick</b>, quick,
<b>quick</b>,
quick, <b>slow</b>, pause; <b>slow</b>, slow, <b>slow</b>, slow; <b>quick</b>,
quick, <b>quick</b>, quick, <b>slow</b>, pause</i> (where boldface represents
the beats used for dancing).
